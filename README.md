# HUMAN_IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION

#Project Description:
We used the scrapper code to collect images of the different Indian faces. The data collection was biased as Indian images were focused on more than the other.  
Once the collection was over we cleared out the images of objects and then of foreigners.  
After doing that we went one step ahead to classify images of Indians as dark, mild, and fair.
